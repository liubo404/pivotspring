## Spring Configuration
There are three ways to define configuration of an application using Spring:
- Special XML configuration files that allow usage of elements described in the associated namespaces
- Java-based configuration classes(classes annotated with @Configuration can be used by Spring IoC as a source for bean definitions)
- Mixed configuration: XML and annotations

All three types of configuration are covered in the following sections. The code sources attached to this chapter will help you test your understanding of each.
