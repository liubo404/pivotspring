## Introduction

So here you are: you want to learn how to develop web applications using Spring,and you chose this study guide to help you. This might be one of the best decisons that you could make, as this book was written not noly to help you to understatnd Spring Web, but to love it as well. This study guide may even help you pass the certification exam--if you follow al the instructions properly and do all the exercises. This study guide explores more Spring Web is all about, which you can skip reading, of course; but if you really want to learn Spring to develop web applications like a professional, then it would be wise not to skip this.

## Spring and What It Does
When buiding a project using Java, a lot of functionality needs to be built from scratch. But a lot of useful functionalities are already built and are free to use of the open source world we live in. A long time ago, when the Java world was still quite small,you would say that you are using a *library* when you used open source code developed by somebody else, shipped as a *.jar file. But as time passed, the software development world evolved and the libraries grew too. They became _frameworks_. Because they were no longer one *.jar file that you could import, they became a collection of more-or-less decoupled libraries with different responsibilityes, and you had the option to import only whaty you needed.

    Released in October 2002 as an open source framework and an inversion of control container developed using Java, Spring was built for the Java platform.
