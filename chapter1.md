# Chapter 1
## Introduction

So here you are: you want to learn how to develop web applications using Spring,and you chose this study guide to help you. This might be one of the best decisons that you could make, as this book was written not noly to help you to understatnd Spring Web, but to love it as well. This study guide may even help you pass the certification exam--if you follow al the instructions properly and do all the exercises. This study guide explores more Spring Web is all about, which you can skip reading, of course; but if you really want to learn Spring to develop web applications like a professional, then it would be wise not to skip this.


## Spring and What It Does
When building a project using Java, a lot of functionality needs to be built from scratch. But a lot of useful functionalities are already built and are free to use because of the open source world we live in. A long time ago, when the Java world was still quite small, you would say that you were using a library when you used open source code developed by somebody else, shipped as a *.jar file. But as time passed, the software development world evolved and the libraries grew too.  They became frameworks. Because they were no longer one *.jar file that you could import, they became a collection of more-or-less decoupled libraries with different responsibilities, and you had the option to import only what you needed.

Release in October 2002 as an open source framework and an inversion of control container developed using Java, Spring was built for the Java platform. It was concieved with the dependency injection software design pattern in mind, and its main purpose is to make dependency handling easier. A Java application is basically a group of objects exchanging data and influencing each other's behavior. The Spring Framework simplified the way in which objects talks to each other and the way they depend on each other. This is why Spring evangelists claim that the reason Java was invented was so that Spring would come into existence one day. The development of Java applications became easier when Spring emerged, providing comprehensive infrastructure support. Spring makes it easier to compose disparate components into a fully working application.

Spring comes with a lot of default behaviors already implemented(components called infrastructure beans are a default configuration; then can be used to create functional basic applications without extra customization), because the Spring Framework was also built with the convention over configuration paradigm as principle, which seeks to decrease the number of decisions a developer has to make when writing code, but also makes it easier for the developer to customize the behavior of objects, offering increased flexibility.

Spring is currently the VIP of Java frameworks and it has been growing exponentially, especially since 2009, when VMware acquired SpringSource, the company behind Spring. The VMware and the EMC Corporation in April 2013, now known as Pivotal, was also advantageous for Spring, as it became one of Pivotal's central elements in its strategy to provide innovative and modern software-driven experiences to its customers. Spring is now a full-blown technoloy that can be used to build enterprise-ready applications in a very short time, and it comes in 25 flavors. Figure 1-1 shows a diagram of all Spring-released projects. The following list describes these projects.# Chapter 1
